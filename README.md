# Numerical Methods to solve Algebraic Equations

An app to solve Algebraic Equations by Numerical Methods

## Features
1. Enter the equation with range and error factor
2. 'Approximate' button for approximating the result
3. Table is generated which has important values for iterations
4. Light and Dark Mode also supports Material You color scheme(Android 12 and above)
5. Choose your theme color(Planning to implement)
